        <h2 style="color:darkred;"> Who are we trying to help?</h2>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
                When thinking about the future it is important to think about who is going to keep society running. That means thinking about all students under the age of 18 who are getting ready to decide what their lives will look like after they finish high school.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
                As time goes on it seems less students in the United States are aiming towards receiving a higher education after high school. Some may take this as proof that students in younger generations are becoming lazier or less motivated for one reason or another. What is highly overlooked is how many factors contribute to a student’s decision to attend college or university, and just how little say they have in the final decision. By taking a closer look at the American public education system it becomes clear that most of the struggles students face stem back to the inadequate funding of schools (K-12) and a lack of community support. <br> 
            <br>
                Even with the steady decrease in college enrollment, which will only lead to negative outcomes for the higher education institutions themselves, it seems no one is eager to make a change. Some higher education institutions even feel as if they will be exempt from what is being called “The Great Interruption” by authors Bill Conely and Robert Massa. But what matters most is not the schools, but the students. Who are the students that are deciding to not attend college? What caused them to make their decision? It comes to no surprise that most of the students unable to attend college come from low income areas, where funding for schools and community involvement are almost nonexistent. In her article, “How Does Place Affect Education?”, Ruth Lupton explores the effects of location and community on a students education and notes, “Evidence from the Gautreaux programme in Chicago suggested that moving to a better neighborhood reduced school drop-out rates, and improved college participation rates” (Lupton, 2006). Obviously schools have the ability to support students in their path towards higher education, but it seems that the families of students have to go out of their way to seek out quality education, when it should be provided no matter where they live, or what their financial status is. <br>
            <br>
                By breaking down the exact influence money and community have over a students education, it is possible to pinpoint where change needs to take place, and how it can be done.

            <p> 
                Community members play a special role in the education of a student. It is crucial that students have support both in school and outside of school, which is where a strong community can help. Things like hosting community fudnraisers, attending various school events, or even just listening to the needs of students, are all great ways to get involved. There are even ways for community members to get involved with policy changes or coming up with programs to provide additional help to students outside of school. Ensuring the best education for students today will only help communities prosper in the future.

                Volunteering at your local schools can help you get an insight on what schools are doing to support their students. It also gives you the opportunity to create bonds with the students in your community, which makes a bigger difference then you think. When students see community members actively helping out at their schools it makes them feel seen. It lets them know that someone does in fact care. Not only is it helpful, but it can also be a fun experience for you as well.

                Teachers and schools are the two main groups of people that can truly help students make a change in the quality of their education. Leaving students to fight for a better education by themselves shoud never be an option. It takes a group effort to begin making solid and long-term changes. A better education for students also means there will be more support for teachers and school as well. Teachers can understand the frustration felt by students because they too experience the struggles caused by a lack of care for the public education system. It is important that teachers, schools, and students maintain a close relationship in their effort to combat poor education quality.

                Many times students feel as if they can have no say in their education. The reality is, now more than ever there is so much that they can do to help bring more attention to improving their education. Students have a right to voice their struggles and take the steps necessary create whatever change they feel is needed. It can be scary to speak out against adults, but it is crucial that they know students will no longer keep quiet when it comes to recieving the quality education they deserve.

    <div class="content">
    <p> Hello, my name is Nuvia Hernandez! I created this mini website for a project in my College Writing 2 class where we had to do research on a topic that related to vocation. I chose to focus on the American public education system and find out if it is truly helping students prepare for their future after high school. Once I completed my research, I found that students are not being supported in the ways they deserve, and decided to put together a few resources on how we can help students now as long-term change is being made for future students.  <br> <br>
    Thank you for checking out the website and I hope you enjoyed looking through it! <br> <br>
